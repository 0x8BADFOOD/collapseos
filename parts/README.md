# Parts

Pieces of code that you can assemble together to make your machine work as you
want them to work.

Collapse OS is built around the z80, but it doesn't mean that your machine can't
mix and match microcontrollers. This is why this folder is subdivided by
architectures.

Obviously, different architectures can't be assembled together in the same
binary, but they can nevertheless be made to work well together.
