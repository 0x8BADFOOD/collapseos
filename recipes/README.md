# Recipes

Because Collapse OS is a meta OS that you assemble yourself on an improvised
machine of your own design, there can't really be a build script. Not a
reliable one anyways.

Because the design of post-collapse machines is hard to predict, it's hard to
write a definitive assembly guide.

The approach we're taking here is a list of recipes: Walkthrough guides for
machines that were built and tried pre-collapse. With a wide enough variety of
recipes, I hope that it will be enough to cover most post-collapse cases.

That's what this folder contains: a list of recipes that uses parts supplied
by Collapse OS to run on some machines people tried.

The structure of those recipes follow a regular pattern: pre-collapse recipe
and post-collapse recipe. That is, instructions to build and install Collapse
OS from a "modern" system, and then, instructions to build and install Collapse
OS from a system running Collapse OS.

Initially, those recipes will only be possible in a "modern" system, but as
tooling improve, we should be able to have recipes that we can consider
complete.
